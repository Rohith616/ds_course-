### What is Spark

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for incremental computation and stream processing.

Apache Spark has transformed the world of Big Data. It is the most active big data tool reshaping the big data market. This open-source distributed computing platform offers more powerful advantages than any other proprietary solutions. The diverse advantages of Apache Spark make it a very attractive big data framework. 

Apache Spark has huge potential to contribute to the big data-related business in the industry. Let’s now have a look at some of the common benefits of Apache Spark:

Benefits of Apache Spark:
- Speed
- Ease of Use
- Advanced Analytics
- Dynamic in Nature
- Multilingual
- Apache Spark is powerful
- Increased access to Big data
- Open-source community

### PySpark

Apache Spark is written in Scala programming language. PySpark has been released in order to support the collaboration of Apache Spark and Python, it actually is a Python API for Spark. In addition, PySpark, helps you interface with Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) in Apache Spark and Python programming language. This has been achieved by taking advantage of the Py4j library. PySpark LogoPy4J is a popular library which is integrated within PySpark and allows python to dynamically interface with JVM objects. PySpark features quite a few libraries for writing efficient programs. Furthermore, there are various external libraries that are also compatible. Here are some of them:

- PySparkSQL
A PySpark library to apply SQL-like analysis on a huge amount of structured or semi-structured data. We can also use SQL queries with PySparkSQL. It can also be connected to Apache Hive. HiveQL can be also be applied. PySparkSQL is a wrapper over the PySpark core. PySparkSQL introduced the DataFrame, a tabular representation of structured data that is similar to that of a table from a relational database management system.

- MLlib
MLlib is a wrapper over the PySpark and it is Spark’s machine learning (ML) library. This library uses the data parallelism technique to store and work with data. The machine-learning API provided by the MLlib library is quite easy to use. MLlib supports many machine-learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and underlying optimization primitives.

- GraphFrames
The GraphFrames is a purpose graph processing library that provides a set of APIs for performing graph analysis efficiently, using the PySpark core and PySparkSQL. It is optimized for fast distributed computing.
