# Transfer Learning 

Transfer learning consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem. For instance, features from a model that has learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify Tanukis.

Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch.
