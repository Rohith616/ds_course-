*MACHINE LEARNING ROADMAP*


***

### Be Professional
The job of an engineer requires the ability to solve the problem by himself. When a student encounters a problem, we don't often give him/her the answer. We will teach you how to solve the problem. By doing so, we aim to develop professionals who can solve problems themselves in the future. **However, please do not take too much time and do not hesitate to ask.** Use us to go ahead and learn quickly.

### Be a Team Player
Technology is a combined effort. All the existing technologies in this world are not made by one person, but by the combined efforts of many engineers. Therefore, we will teach how to develop smoothly as a team and how to use the latest technology.

### Enjoy Programming
Through engineering, we can see the mechanism of things that we have never seen before, and the way we see things in the world will change. And you can create what you desire to build. Let's enjoy the excitement of programming.
