# Introduction to SQL

This introductory read up will guide you to set up a small local MySQL set up and then also help you discover [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)

## Databases are everywhere !

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.

## What Can SQL do for you?

- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve data from a database
- SQL can insert records in a database
- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

## In Summary

- SQL is Productive
- SQL is Fast
- SQL is Awesome
And SQL is here to stay !

It is still the leading choice for many industries and SQL as a language is the primary driver for the Data Storage Intelligence domain.

## What SQL looks like ?

So like every programming languages, The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP. These commands can be classified into the following groups based on their nature - 

**DDL - Data Definition Language**

DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.

| Serial Number | Command & Description                                                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       1       | CREATE  Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in the database.   |
|       2       | ALTER  Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.                      |
|       3       | DROP  Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other objects in the database. |

**DML - Data Manipulation Language**

The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements.

| Serial Number | Command & Description                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|       1       | SELECT  Retrieves certain records from one or more tables. |
|       2       | INSERT  Creates a record.                                  |
|       3       | UPDATE  Modifies records.                                  |
|       4       | DELETE  Deletes records.                                   |

**DCL - Data Control Language**

DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deals with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database system.

| Serial Number | Command & Description                            |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|       1       | GRANT  Gives a privilege to user.                |
|       2       | REVOKE  Takes back privileges granted from user. |

SQL language makes use these commands to interact with databases like the one you hosted yourself!
