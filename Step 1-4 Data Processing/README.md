# Goal 

## [01 Numpy](01_Numpy)

- [Manipulating Data With Numpy](01_Numpy/ManipulatingDataWithNumpy.ipynb)

Using the Numpy library for python to deal with data manipulation. Numpy has arrays which are very effective to help deal with data. Numpy's main purpose is for linear algebra. Any kind of data preprocessing can be done in Numpy. Here's what you'll learn in the notebook. 
  - Introduction to NumPy
  - NumPy Object Creation
  - Matrix Creation
  - Indexing and Slicing
  - Vectorization
  - Broadcasting
  
## [02 Pandas](02_Pandas)
Pandas is a library that is very good at managing tabular data. It can even read the Json format. Pandas is built on top of Numpy and thus is very fast. Pandas can be used to connect to a variety of sources for reading data. It also has a lot of summarisation, grouping and aggregation functions built into it. Here's what you'll learn in the following chapters:

- [Creating Dataframes](02_Pandas/Step_1_4a_Pandas_Series_and_DataFrames.ipynb)
- [Maniupulation](02_Pandas/Step_1_4b_Pandas_Summary_Functions_and_Maps.ipynb)
- [Grouping](02_Pandas/Step_1_4c_Pandas_Grouping_and_Sorting.ipynb)
- [Data Types](02_Pandas/Step_1_4d_Pandas__Data_Types__Missing_Data__Renaming_and_Combining.ipynb)
- [Graphical Representations](02_Pandas/Step_1_4e_Pandas_Data_Visualization.ipynb)
- [Data Preprocessing using FIFA Dataset](02_Pandas/Step_2_Data_Pre_Processing_Techniques_FIFA_19_Dataset.ipynb)

## [03 Assigment](03_Assignment/Assignment_PANDAS_NUMPY.ipynb)
As set of 10 questions to test your knowledge on Numpy and Pandas. Please submit the assignment to your cohort manager via slack.
